# Phase 2 Chart Fix & Next Steps

## ✅ Fixed: Server Data Now Appears in Charts

### Problem
Charts only showed ICMP tests (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8) but excluded server-based tests (schueller.pro).

### Root Cause
Chart generation code filtered for `test_type == "icmp"` only, ignoring `test_type == "server_echo"` measurements.

### Solution
Updated both PNG and HTML chart generation to include:
```rust
if (m.test_type == "icmp" || m.test_type == "server_echo") && m.status == "success" {
```

### Result
- ✅ Charts now show all three targets: 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, **schueller.pro**
- ✅ 924 measurements total (250 + 250 + 241 + extra = ~741 displayed)
- ✅ Server latency data visible in charts

## 📋 Your Questions & Answers

### Q1: "The chart for the server (schueller.pro) should have more detailed statistics, as we can distinguish up and down timings?"

**Answer:** ✅ **Excellent idea!** This is absolutely correct and now specified in `CHART_ENHANCEMENTS.md`.

**Current State (Phase 2):**
- Server sends back timestamps in ECHO_REPLY
- We calculate total RTT but don't break it down
- Database only stores `rtt_ms`

**Proposed Enhancement (Phase 2.1):**
- Calculate **upload latency** (client → server)
- Calculate **download latency** (server → client)
- Calculate **server processing time**
- Store all three in database
- Visualize as separate lines in charts:
  - 🔵 Upload (shows WiFi/local network upload)
  - 🟢 Download (shows WiFi/local network download)
  - 🔴 Total RTT (combined)

**Benefit:**
- Identify asymmetric issues: "Upload is slow (50ms) but download is fast (10ms)"
- Separate WiFi issues from Internet issues
- See server processing delays vs network delays

---

### Q2: "Will the chart show alerts, packet drops and other anomalies?"

**Answer:** ❌ **Not yet, but now specified!** See `CHART_ENHANCEMENTS.md` for complete plan.

**Current State (Phase 2):**
- Alerts logged to console/file only
- Packet loss stored in database but not visualized
- No anomaly detection

**Proposed Enhancements (Phase 2.1-2.4):**

#### 1. Packet Loss Visualization (Phase 2.1)
- Add separate track below latency chart
- Show loss percentage as bar chart (0-100%)
- Color-coded: Green/Yellow/Orange/Red
- Hover for details: "5% packet loss at 22:15"

#### 2. Alert Markers (Phase 2.1)
- Vertical lines at alert timestamps
- Icons at top: ⚠️ Warning, 🚨 Alert, ❌ Critical
- Hover tooltip: "High Latency Alert: 156ms (threshold: 100ms)"
- Alert timeline track below packet loss

#### 3. Anomaly Detection (Phase 2.3)
- **Latency Spikes:** Detect >3× moving average
- **Micro-Outages:** 3+ consecutive timeouts
- **Degradation Events:** Sustained +50% latency
- **High Jitter:** stddev >50ms in short window
- Visualize with markers, shading, and labels

#### 4. Example Enhanced Chart
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Latency                      🚨      ⚠️        │
│ 100ms ┤  ╭─╮       ╭──╮  🔺        │         │

│       └─────────────────────────────┤         │
│ Alerts                              │         │

└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

### ✅ Completed (Just Now)
- Server data appears in charts
- Fixed test_type filtering

### 📍 Phase 2.1 - Quick Wins (~2-4 hours)
**Priority: HIGH** (immediately useful)

1. **Add packet loss track** 
   - Show where packets were lost
   - Bar chart below latency
   
2. **Add alert markers**
   - Show when alerts triggered
   - Vertical lines with icons
   
3. **Store one-way latencies**
   - Calculate upload/download from existing timestamps
   - Add database columns
   - No breaking changes

**Estimated time:** 2-4 hours  
**User value:** High - immediate visibility into problems

### 📍 Phase 2.2 - Enhanced Server Stats (~4-6 hours)
**Priority: MEDIUM** (nice to have, very useful)

1. **Visualize upload/download separately**
   - Three lines for server targets (up/down/total)
   - One line for ICMP targets
   
2. **Add server processing time**
   - Show how much delay is server vs network
   
3. **Enhanced tooltips**
   - Detailed timing breakdown
   - Show all four timestamps

**Estimated time:** 4-6 hours
