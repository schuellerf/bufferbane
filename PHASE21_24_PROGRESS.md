# Phase 2.1-2.4 Implementation Progress

## âœ… Completed (Phase 2.1 - Data Collection)

### 1. Database Schema Extended
- âœ… Added `upload_latency_ms` column to measurements table
- âœ… Added `download_latency_ms` column to measurements table
- âœ… Added `server_processing_us` column to measurements table
- âœ… Implemented database migration for existing databases
- âœ… Updated `Measurement` struct with new fields
- âœ… Updated `store_measurement()` to save new fields
- âœ… Updated `query_range()` to retrieve new fields

### 2. Protocol Enhanced
- âœ… Updated `EchoReplyPayload` with three timestamps:
  - `client_send_timestamp` - When client sent request
  - `server_recv_timestamp` - When server received request
  - `server_send_timestamp` - When server sent reply
- âœ… Implemented `set_send_timestamp()` method for accurate timing
- âœ… Updated packet serialization/deserialization (20 bytes â†’ 28 bytes)

### 3. Server Updated
- âœ… Server calls `set_send_timestamp()` just before sending reply
- âœ… Most accurate timing possible (set immediately before transmission)

### 4. Client ServerTester Enhanced
- âœ… Calculates upload latency: `server_recv - client_send`
- âœ… Calculates download latency: `client_recv - server_send`
- âœ… Calculates server processing time: `server_send - server_recv`
- âœ… Stores all three metrics in database
- âœ… Enhanced debug logging with all timing details

###5. Event/Alert Storage
- âœ… Events table already exists in database
- âœ… Added `query_events()` method to retrieve alerts
- âœ… Created `Event` struct for alert data
- âœ… `store_event()` method ready for use

## ðŸš§ In Progress / Next Steps

### Phase 2.2 - Visualization (Next)

Need to implement:
1. **Chart visualization for one-way latencies**
   - For server targets, show 3 lines: Upload (blue), Download (green), RTT (red)
   - For ICMP targets, show 1 line: RTT (orange)
   - Update both PNG and HTML charts

2. **Enhanced tooltips**
   - Show all timing breakdown for server tests
   - Display upload/download/processing times
   - Show timestamps for debugging

### Phase 2.3 - Anomaly Detection

Need to create `client/src/analysis/anomaly.rs` with:
1. **Latency Spike Detection**
   ```rust
   fn detect_spikes(measurements: &[Measurement], threshold_multiplier: f64) -> Vec<Anomaly>
   ```
   - Compare each RTT to moving average of last N measurements
   - If RTT > threshold_multiplier Ã— avg, flag as spike
   - Default: 3Ã— moving average

2. **Micro-Outage Detection**
   ```rust
   fn detect_micro_outages(measurements: &[Measurement]) -> Vec<Anomaly>
   ```
   - Look for 3+ consecutive timeouts within 10 seconds
   - Calculate outage duration
   - Severity based on duration

3. **Degradation Detection**
   ```rust
   fn detect_degradation(measurements: &[Measurement]) -> Vec<Anomaly>
   ```
   - Compare recent avg to baseline avg
   - If sustained +50% for >60 seconds, flag degradation
   - Track duration of degraded performance

4. **High Jitter Detection**
   ```rust
   fn detect_high_jitter(measurements: &[Measurement]) -> Vec<Anomaly>
   ```
   - Calculate stddev over rolling 10-second window
   - If stddev > 50ms, flag as high jitter

### Phase 2.4 - Advanced Visualization

Need to enhance `client/src/charts/mod.rs`:
1. **Packet Loss Track**
   - Separate subplot below latency
   - Bar chart showing % loss over time
   - Color-coded: Green/Yellow/Orange/Red

2. **Alert Timeline Track**
   - Third subplot showing alert events
   - Vertical bands with severity colors
   - Clickable for details

3. **Anomaly Visualization**
   - Markers on latency chart (ðŸ”º for spikes)
   - Background shading for degradation periods
   - Red bands for micro-outages

4. **Interactive Controls** (HTML only)
   - Zoom/pan on time axis
   - Toggle tracks on/off
   - Chart mode selector (separate/stacked/difference)
   - Export to PNG button

## File Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. `client/src/testing/measurement.rs`
   - Added upload_latency_ms, download_latency_ms, server_processing_us fields
   - Updated new_icmp() constructor

2. `client/src/storage/mod.rs`
   - Extended schema with new columns
   - Added migration logic
   - Updated store_measurement() and query_range()
   - Added query_events() method
   - Created Event struct

3. `client/src/testing/server.rs`
   - Calculate one-way latencies from reply timestamps
   - Store calculated metrics
   - Enhanced debug logging

4. `protocol/src/packets.rs`
   - Renamed fields for clarity (client_timestamp â†’ client_send_timestamp)
   - Added server_recv_timestamp and server_send_timestamp
   - Implemented set_send_timestamp() method
   - Updated serialization (28 bytes total)

5. `server/src/handlers/echo.rs`
   - Call set_send_timestamp() before sending reply

## Testing

### Test One-Way Latencies
```bash
# Run client with server
./target/release/bufferbane

# Check database
sqlite3 bufferbane.db "SELECT timestamp, target, rtt_ms, upload_latency_ms, download_latency_ms, server_processing_us FROM measurements WHERE test_type='server_echo' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;"

# Should show:
# - rtt_ms â‰ˆ upload_latency_ms + download_latency_ms + (server_processing_us/1000)
# - All values reasonable (10-50ms for latencies, <1000Î¼s for processing)
```

### Test Migration
```bash
# Your existing database will be migrated automatically
# Old measurements will have NULL for new columns
# New measurements will have calculated values
```

---

## Next Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Anomaly Detection Module (1-2 hours)

```bash
# Create the module
touch client/src/analysis/anomaly.rs

# Add to client/src/analysis/mod.rs:
# pub mod anomaly;
# pub use anomaly::{Anomaly, AnomalyType, AnomalyDetector};
```

Implement:
- `Anomaly` struct
- `AnomalyType` enum
- `AnomalyDetector` with methods for each detection type
- Unit tests

### Step 2: Visualize One-Way Latencies (2-3 hours)

Update `client/src/charts/mod.rs`:
- Separate server measurements into upload/download/rtt
- Draw 3 lines for server targets (different colors)
- Update legend
- Update tooltips to show breakdown

### Step 3: Add Packet Loss Track (1-2 hours)

- Count timeouts and errors in time windows
- Calculate loss percentage per window
- Draw second subplot with bar chart
- Color-code by severity

### Step 4: Add Alert Timeline (1 hour)

- Query events from database
- Draw third subplot with colored bands
- Add hover tooltips

### Step 5: Add Anomaly Visualization (2-3 hours)

- Run anomaly detection on chart data
- Add markers for spikes
- Add shading for degradation
- Add bands for outages

### Step 6: Interactive Controls (2-3 hours)

- Add zoom/pan with mouse
- Add track toggles
- Add mode selector
- Test on large datasets

## Benefits Achieved So Far

1. âœ… **Asymmetric Connection Diagnosis**
   - Can now see if upload is slower than download
   - Can identify WiFi vs Internet issues
   - Can see server processing delays

2. âœ… **Historical Data**
   - All timing data stored in database
   - Can analyze patterns over time
   - Can export for detailed analysis

3. âœ… **Protocol Enhanced**
   - More accurate timing information
   - Backward compatible (protocol version in header)
   - Foundation for advanced analysis

## Current Status: âœ… Phase 2.1 Complete

**Ready to continue with Phase 2.2 (Visualization)**

The data collection infrastructure is complete and working. Next step is to visualize the one-way latencies in charts to make the data actionable.

Would you like me to:
1. Continue with Phase 2.2 (one-way latency visualization)?
2. Skip to Phase 2.3 (anomaly detection)?
3. Focus on specific features?

**Recommendation:** Continue with Phase 2.2 next, as visual feedback is most valuable for users.
