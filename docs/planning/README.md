# Planning Documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è These documents are from the planning phase and represent the specification and research done before implementation.**

While these documents are valuable references, the actual implementation may differ slightly as practical considerations emerged during development. For current implementation details, see the main README and source code.

## Planning Documents

### Core Specification
- **[SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md)** - Complete technical specification including protocol details, database schema, and architecture
- **[SCENARIOS.md](SCENARIOS.md)** - Network instability scenarios and detection strategies specific to cable internet
- **[PHASE_SUMMARY.md](PHASE_SUMMARY.md)** - 4-phase implementation roadmap with features and timelines

### Architecture & Design
- **[RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md)** - Evaluation of existing tools, gap analysis, and technology stack selection
- **[SERVER_COMPONENT.md](SERVER_COMPONENT.md)** - Server component design (Phase 2)
- **[MULTI_INTERFACE.md](MULTI_INTERFACE.md)** - Multi-interface monitoring design (Phase 4)
- **[ENCRYPTION_SECURITY.md](ENCRYPTION_SECURITY.md)** - Security model and encryption details (Phase 2+)

### Technical Decisions
- **[RRD_VS_SQLITE.md](RRD_VS_SQLITE.md)** - Database technology decision analysis

## Implementation Status

**Phase 1**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** (October 2025)
- Standalone ICMP monitoring
- SQLite storage
- CSV export
- PNG chart generation with statistics

**Phase 2-4**: üìã Planned (see documents above)

## Notes

These documents total ~5000+ lines and represent comprehensive planning. They include:
- Detailed protocol specifications that will be used in Phase 2
- Security models using ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption
- Multi-interface support design
- Complete data models and schemas

The planning was intentionally thorough to ensure a solid foundation for all phases of development.
