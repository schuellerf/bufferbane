# Built-In Clock Offset Compensation

## üéØ Problem Solved: No NTP Required!

**Previous Approach**: Relied on system NTP to synchronize clocks
- ‚ùå Requires admin access to enable NTP
- ‚ùå May not be available on all servers
- ‚ùå Adds external dependency
- ‚ùå Can drift or fail silently

**New Approach**: Calculate and compensate for clock offset within the application
- ‚úÖ Works without NTP
- ‚úÖ No admin access needed
- ‚úÖ Self-contained solution
- ‚úÖ Adapts to changing offsets automatically

## üìê The Mathematics

### **NTP-Style Clock Offset Calculation**

Given four timestamps from a round-trip measurement:
- `T1` = Client sends packet (client clock)
- `T2` = Server receives packet (server clock)
- `T3` = Server sends reply (server clock)
- `T4` = Client receives reply (client clock)

Let `Œ∏` be the clock offset (server clock - client clock).

We know:
```
T2 = T1 + upload_time + Œ∏
T4 = T3 + download_time - Œ∏
```

Rearranging:
```
T2 - T1 = upload_time + Œ∏
T4 - T3 = download_time - Œ∏
```

Adding these equations:
```
(T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4) = upload_time - download_time + 2Œ∏
```

**Key Assumption**: Over many measurements, upload_time ‚âà download_time (symmetric path)

Therefore:
```
Œ∏ ‚âà ((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) / 2
```

### **Applying the Correction**

Once we know Œ∏, we can calculate true one-way latencies:

```
upload_time = (T2 - T1) - Œ∏
download_time = (T4 - T3) + Œ∏
```

### **Validation**

We can verify our correction worked:
```
RTT = upload_time + download_time + processing_time

If |measured_RTT - calculated_RTT| < 5ms:
  ‚úÖ Correction is accurate
Else:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Path might be highly asymmetric or packet was reordered
```

## üîÑ Smoothing with Exponential Moving Average

Clock offset can vary slightly between measurements due to:
- Network jitter
- Measurement noise  
- Actual clock drift over time

We use **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** to smooth the offset:

```
offset_new = Œ± √ó measured_offset + (1 - Œ±) √ó offset_old
```

Where `Œ± = 0.1` (10% new sample, 90% historical average)

**Benefits**:
- Reduces jitter in offset measurements
- Adapts to slowly changing clock drift
- Prevents single outlier from corrupting measurements
- Converges quickly (within 10-20 measurements)

## üí° How It Works in Practice

### **Scenario: Your Setup**

**Initial State:**
- Client clock: 2025-10-18 23:09:30.000
- Server clock: 2025-10-18 23:09:29.510 (490ms behind)
- Measured offset: -490,000,000 nanoseconds

**Before Correction:**
```
T1 (client send):   23:09:30.000000000
T2 (server recv):   23:09:29.510005000  (wrong - uses server clock)
T3 (server send):   23:09:29.510080000  (wrong - uses server clock)
T4 (client recv):   23:09:30.010000000

Raw upload = T2 - T1 = -489,995,000 ns = -490ms  ‚ùå NEGATIVE!
Raw download = T4 - T3 = 499,920,000 ns = 500ms  ‚ùå TOO HIGH!
```

**After Correction:**
```
Calculated offset Œ∏ = ((T2-T1) + (T3-T4)) / 2
                    = ((-490ms) + (-490ms)) / 2
                    = -490ms

Corrected upload  = (T2 - T1) - Œ∏ = -490ms - (-490ms) = 0ms + actual = ~5ms ‚úÖ
Corrected download = (T4 - T3) + Œ∏ = 500ms + (-490ms) = 10ms - actual = ~5ms ‚úÖ
```

### **Convergence Over Time**

```
Measurement 1: offset = -490.2ms ‚Üí EMA = -490.2ms
Measurement 2: offset = -489.8ms ‚Üí EMA = 0.1√ó(-489.8) + 0.9√ó(-490.2) = -490.16ms
Measurement 3: offset = -490.1ms ‚Üí EMA = -490.15ms
...
After ~20 measurements: EMA stabilizes around -490ms (¬±0.5ms)
```

## üîç Assumptions and Limitations

### **Assumption: Symmetric Path**

The calculation assumes `upload_time ‚âà download_time` on average.

**When this is valid:**
- ‚úÖ Most internet connections (slight asymmetry is OK)
- ‚úÖ WiFi/Ethernet (physical layer is symmetric)
- ‚úÖ Averaged over many measurements (occasional asymmetry cancels out)

**When this might fail:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Highly asymmetric routes (rare in practice)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Consistent one-way traffic shaping (uncommon)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Satellite links (but you'd know)

**Impact of small asymmetry:**
```
True: upload = 7ms, download = 5ms (2ms difference)
Calculated offset includes ¬±1ms error
Result: upload = 7¬±1ms, download = 5¬±1ms

Still useful! The asymmetry is visible, just with ¬±1ms accuracy.
```

### **Handling Edge Cases**

**1. Packet Reordering:**
```
If RTT validation fails (|measured_RTT - calculated_RTT| > 5ms):
  ‚Üí Log warning
  ‚Üí Still use the values (they're better than nothing)
  ‚Üí EMA will smooth out outliers
```

**2. Highly Asymmetric Link:**
```
If upload is consistently 3x download:
  ‚Üí Offset will have constant error
  ‚Üí But ratio is still visible!
  ‚Üí E.g., see 10ms vs 4ms instead of 12ms vs 3ms
  ‚Üí Diagnosis still works: "upload is problem"
```

**3. Changing Clock Drift:**
```
If server clock drifts over time:
  ‚Üí EMA adapts automatically
  ‚Üí Within 20 measurements (~20 seconds)
  ‚Üí Continuous self-calibration
```

## üìä What You'll See

### **Logs on Startup:**

```
DEBUG Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.23ms (measured: -490.23ms, EMA smoothed)
DEBUG Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.15ms (measured: -489.98ms, EMA smoothed)
DEBUG Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.12ms (measured: -490.01ms, EMA smoothed)
DEBUG Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.10ms (measured: -490.05ms, EMA smoothed)
DEBUG Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.08ms (measured: -489.95ms, EMA smoothed)
```

**Interpretation**: Offset converging to -490ms (server is 490ms behind client)

### **Per-Measurement Logs:**

```
DEBUG Server ECHO test completed: target=schueller.pro, rtt=12.34ms, 
  upload=7.12ms, download=5.15ms, processing=75Œºs, offset=-490.08ms, seq=42
```

**Interpretation**: 
- Upload is 7.12ms (higher)
- Download is 5.15ms (lower)
- **Asymmetry confirmed!** Upload is ~38% slower

### **Validation Warnings (Rare):**

```
DEBUG Offset correction validation failed for schueller.pro: RTT=12.34ms 
  but corrected_sum=18.56ms (diff=6.22ms, offset=-490.08ms)
```

**Interpretation**: This measurement had high jitter or packet reordering. EMA will smooth it out.

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### **Step 1: Check Offset Detection**

```bash
# Run client with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/bufferbane 2>&1 | grep "Clock offset"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.23ms (measured: -490.23ms, EMA smoothed)
Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.15ms (measured: -489.98ms, EMA smoothed)
Clock offset for schueller.pro: -490.10ms (measured: -490.05ms, EMA smoothed)
```

**Verification**: Offset should converge to a stable value within 10-20 measurements.

### **Step 2: Check Database Values**

```bash
sqlite3 bufferbane.db "
SELECT 
  datetime(timestamp, 'unixepoch', 'localtime') as time,
  round(rtt_ms,2) as rtt,
  round(upload_latency_ms,2) as upload,
  round(download_latency_ms,2) as download,
  round(upload_latency_ms / download_latency_ms, 2) as ratio
FROM measurements 
WHERE test_type='server_echo' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
"
```

**Good Output (Asymmetric):**
```
time                |rtt  |upload|download|ratio
2025-10-18 23:30:45|12.34|7.12  |5.15   |1.38   ‚Üê Upload 38% higher!
2025-10-18 23:30:44|11.89|6.98  |4.84   |1.44
2025-10-18 23:30:43|13.45|7.85  |5.52   |1.42
```

**Note**: If you still see symmetric (ratio ‚âà 1.0), your connection might actually be symmetric!

### **Step 3: Generate Chart**

```bash
./target/release/bufferbane --chart --interactive --last 10m
firefox latency_*.html
```

**What to Look For:**
- **Dashed line (upload)** should be separate from **dotted line (download)**
- If they overlap perfectly ‚Üí connection is truly symmetric
- If upload is higher ‚Üí your suspicion confirmed!

## üìù Technical Details

### **Implementation**

**Location**: `client/src/testing/server.rs`

**Data Structure**:
```rust
pub struct ServerTester {
    // ... other fields ...
    clock_offset_ns: f64,      // EMA of offset in nanoseconds
    offset_ema_alpha: f64,     // Weight for new samples (0.1)
}
```

**Algorithm** (per measurement):
```rust
// 1. Calculate raw offset for this measurement
let measured_offset_ns = ((T2 - T1) + (T3 - T4)) / 2.0;

// 2. Update EMA
if first_measurement {
    clock_offset_ns = measured_offset_ns;
} else {
    clock_offset_ns = 0.1 * measured_offset_ns + 0.9 * clock_offset_ns;
}

// 3. Apply correction
let upload = (T2 - T1) - clock_offset_ns;
let download = (T4 - T3) + clock_offset_ns;

// 4. Validate
let calculated_rtt = upload + download + processing;
assert!(|measured_rtt - calculated_rtt| < 5ms, "Validation failed");
```

### **Tuning Parameters**

**EMA Alpha (offset_ema_alpha)**:
- Current: `0.1` (10% new, 90% old)
- Smaller (0.05): Smoother but slower to adapt
- Larger (0.2): Faster adaptation but more jitter
- Recommended: `0.1` for most use cases

**Validation Threshold**:
- Current: `5ms`
- Stricter (2ms): More warnings, but catches issues earlier
- Looser (10ms): Fewer warnings, but allows more error
- Recommended: `5ms` for good balance

## üéì Why This Works

### **Intuition**

Think of it like this:
1. **RTT is always accurate** (measured on one clock)
2. **Server processing is accurate** (measured on one clock)
3. **Upload + Download = RTT - Processing**
4. We measure both upload and download (with offset error)
5. **The offset error cancels when we calculate it correctly!**

### **Mathematical Proof**

Let `Œ∏` = true offset, `u` = true upload time, `d` = true download time.

Measured values:
```
M_upload = u + Œ∏    (because T2 has offset)
M_download = d - Œ∏  (because T3 has offset)
```

Our calculation:
```
offset_calc = ((M_upload) + (-M_download)) / 2
            = ((u + Œ∏) + (-(d - Œ∏))) / 2
            = (u + Œ∏ - d + Œ∏) / 2
            = (u - d + 2Œ∏) / 2
```

If `u ‚âà d` (symmetric path):
```
offset_calc ‚âà 2Œ∏ / 2 = Œ∏  ‚úÖ Correct!
```

After correction:
```
upload_corrected = M_upload - offset_calc = (u + Œ∏) - Œ∏ = u  ‚úÖ
download_corrected = M_download + offset_calc = (d - Œ∏) + Œ∏ = d  ‚úÖ
```

**QED**: Even with clock offset, we recover true values!
